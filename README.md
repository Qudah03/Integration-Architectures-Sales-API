# 🌐 Integration Architectures Sales API

This project implements a basic **RESTful API** for managing salesman data.  
Its primary goal is to demonstrate **fundamental JavaScript concepts** and the principles of a **modular, layered architecture** (Controller–Service–Repository) using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features Demonstrated (Assignment 2.1-a)

- **Layered Architecture (C–S–R):**  
  Clear separation of concerns across Controller, Service, and Repository layers for maintainability.

- **Module System:**  
  Dedicated `bonusCalculator` module isolates business logic.

- **RESTful Endpoints:**  
  Basic `GET` routes for fetching salesman data, calculating bonuses, and aggregating totals.

- **Asynchronous Concepts:**  
  Foundation laid for Promises and `async/await` (to be extended in later stages).

- **Cookie Handling:**  
  Routes demonstrate cookie operations using the `cookie-parser` middleware.

| Component       | Role                 | Version / Notes               |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Runtime**     | Node.js              | v22.21.0 or newer             |
| **Framework**   | Express.js           | API core                      |
| **Middleware**  | cookie-parser        | Cookie management             |
| **Testing**     | Postman              | For testing endpoints          |
| **Version Control** | Git / GitHub     | For versioning and tracking   |

## 📂 Project Structure

The project strictly follows the **Controller–Service–Repository (C–S–R)** pattern for modularity and clarity.

## ⚙️ Setup and Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js:** LTS version or newer installed.  
- **npm:** Comes bundled with Node.js.

### Installation and Startup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Qudah03/Integration-Architectures-Sales-API.git
   cd Integration-Architectures-Sales-API
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

The server will start on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Console output:

```
Server is running on port 3000
Application structure is C-S-R based.
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints (GET)

Use a browser or **Postman** to test the following routes:

| Method  | Endpoint        | Description                                                                       |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GET** | `/salesmen`     | Returns all salesman records including calculated bonuses (10% of sales).         |
| **GET** | `/salesmen/:id` | Returns a single salesman by ID (e.g. `/salesmen/2`) with calculated bonus.       |
| **GET** | `/totals`       | Returns `totalSales` and `totalBonus` across all salesmen (also logs to console). |
| **GET** | `/set-cookie`   | Sets a `session_id` cookie in the browser.                                        |
| **GET** | `/get-cookies`  | Reads and returns cookies sent by the client.                                     |
| **GET** | `/clear-cookie` | Deletes the `session_id` cookie from the browser.                                 |

## 🧩 Notes

* Future updates will include asynchronous data fetching, Promises, and database integration.
* The current version uses **in-memory data** for demonstration.
* Designed for **Integration Architectures coursework (Assignment 2.1-a)**.
